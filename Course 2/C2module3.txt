Data Life Cycle

PLAN for the users who will work within a spreadsheet by developing organizational standards. This can mean formatting your cells, the headings you choose to highlight, the color scheme, and the way you order your data points. When you take the time to set these standards, you will improve communication, ensure consistency, and help people be more efficient with their time.

CAPTURE data by the source by connecting spreadsheets to other data sources, such as an online survey application or a database. This data will automatically be updated in the spreadsheet. That way, the information is always as current and accurate as possible.

MANAGE different kinds of data with a spreadsheet. This can involve storing, organizing, filtering, and updating information. Spreadsheets also let you decide who can access the data, how the information is shared, and how to keep your data safe and secure.

ANALYZE data in a spreadsheet to help make better decisions. Some of the most common spreadsheet analysis tools include formulas to aggregate data or create reports, and pivot tables for clear, easy-to-understand visuals.

ARCHIVE any spreadsheet that you don’t use often, but might need to reference later with built-in tools. This is especially useful if you want to store historical data before it gets updated.

DESTROY your spreadsheet when you are certain that you will never need it again, if you have better backup copies, or for legal or security reasons. Keep in mind, lots of businesses are required to follow certain rules or have measures in place to make sure data is destroyed properly.

Operators - a symbol that names the type of operation or calculation to be performed
+ - = / * () & %
Formulas in spreadsheets START with an = sign.
example:
    =A3-B3
    =(A2 * C2)/C2
    =(A2+B2+C2+D2)/4

Cell reference - A cell or range of cells in a worksheet that can be used in a formula
Range - A collection of 2 or more cells

Formulas
The basics
When you enter a formula in math, it generally ends with an equal sign (2 + 3 = ?). But with formulas, they always start with one instead (=A2+A3). The equal sign tells the spreadsheet that what follows is part of a formula, not just a word or number in a cell.

After you enter the equal sign, most spreadsheet applications will display an autocomplete menu that lists valid formulas, names, and text strings. This is a great way to create and edit formulas while avoiding typing and syntax errors.

A fun way to learn new formulas is just by typing an equal sign and a single letter of the alphabet. Choose one of the options that pops up and you will learn what that formula does.

Auto-filling
The lower-right corner of each cell has a fill handle. It is a small green square in Microsoft Excel and a small blue circle in Google Sheets.

Click the fill handle square or circle for a cell and drag it down a column to auto-fill other cells in the column with the same value or formula in that cell.

Click the fill handle square or circle for a cell and drag it across a row to auto-fill other cells in the row with the same value or formula in that cell.

If you want to create a numbered sequence in a column or row, do the following:
1) Fill in the first two numbers of the sequence in two adjacent cells,
2) Select to highlight the cells, and
3) Drag the fill handle square or circle to the last cell to complete the sequence of numbers. For example, to insert 1 through 100 in each row of column A, enter 1 in cell A1 and 2 in cell A2. Then, select to highlight both cells, click the fill handle square or circle in cell A2, and drag it down to cell A100. This auto-fills the numbers sequentially so you don't have to enter them in each cell.

Absolute referencing
Absolute referencing is marked by a dollar sign ($). For example, =$A$10 has absolute referencing for both the column and the row value

Relative references (which is what you normally do, e.g. “=A10”) will change anytime the formula is copied and pasted. They are in relation to where the referenced cell is located. For example if you copied “=A10” to the cell to the right it would become “=B10”. With absolute referencing “=$A$10” copied to the cell to the right would remain “=$A$10”. But if you copied $A10 to the cell below, it would change to $A11 because the row value isn't an absolute reference.

Absolute references will not change when you copy and paste the formula in a different cell. The cell being referenced is always the same.

To easily switch between absolute and relative referencing in the formula bar, highlight the reference you want to change and press the F4 key; for example, if you want to change the absolute reference, $A$10, in your formula to a relative reference, A10, highlight $A$10 in the formula bar and then press the F4 key to make the change.
